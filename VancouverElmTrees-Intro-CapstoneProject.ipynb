    "<B>Vancouver city is concerned that the 2,863 elm trees planted throughout the city may be at risk of a deadly disease spread by similar plants in the Ulmaceae/Cannabaceae family.</B>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dutch Elm Disease (DED) killed 25 million elms in Britain alone, before spreading to North America in imported logs. The disease changed the city landscapes, as many 50+ year old trees up to a meter across previously lined the streets. The cost to remove dead trees and replant was extermely expensive. The disease is caused by a fungus that is transmitted by air and also by bark beetles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A similar beetle infestation has decimated 18 million hectares of BC forests, leaving millions of dead trees that increase the severity of forest fires. Though not related to elms, this has sensitized western Canada to the loss of trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Canada currently has fines up to \\\\$50,000 for moving firewood between regions to stop the transmission of dutch elm, beetles, and other tree diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The value of the 700,000 elm trees in Canada was estimated at \\\\$2.5 billion dollars in 1999. The tree value and removal cost for a lost tree can be \\\\$10k per tree, making the exposure to the city approximately \\\\$28 million dollars.  \n",
